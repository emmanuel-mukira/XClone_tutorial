Every time I learn something new coz I want to understand logic and syntax for Jetpack Compose , Recycler View and Firebase intergration. Take the code of the current file and explain it in a explainer.md file explaining what the code does explaining the syntax , and it's purpose in the overall system. The aim for this is for me to understand the code as well so when I am doing my Mobile Application Development exam I can write code well.
